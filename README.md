## Script descriptions

**make_presence_absence.py**- Reads in the chemicals and associated keyword sets from the CPCat Chemical List Presence dataset **factotum_listPresence_092320_updated_chemnames_020621.csv**, the mapping of CPCat keywords to exposure source categories **keyword_esc.csv**, and ToxCast chemicals of interest from the **PositiveChemicals** sheet of **ToxCast_PPARg_DataPull_050321.xlsx**. Chemicals from both the CPCat and ToxCast datasets are identified as DTXSIDs. It is noted which of the chemicals contained in the CPCat dataset are also contained in the ToxCast dataset. Exposure source categories are mapped to all chemicals in the CPCat dataset based on associated keywords. Duplicate chemical/ exposure source category pairs are dropped and a filter is applied to only keep chemicals that are linked to at least two unique exposure source categories. An nxm dataframe is produced where n is the number of chemicals that pass the >=2 exposure source category filter, and m is the number of exposure source categories. A 1 in the dataframe indicates that there is an association between the chemical and the exposure source category, and 0 indicates there is not an association. The dataframe is written to the file **presence_absence_binary_df_DTXSID.csv**, which serves as one of the the input to **toxcast_cluster.R**. Additionally, a reference file **name_dtxsid_ref.csv** is produced which maps the true_chemname to the DTXSID for each chemical, according to the original CPCat dataset. Both of these files are written to an *output* folder.

**cluster.R**- reads in the binary dataframe and the chemical name- DTXSID mapping produced by **data_mgmt.py**. A distance matrix of the presence/absence data was created using by computing a jaccard distance for each combination of DTXSIDs. This matrix, as well as a dataframe derived from melting the values of this matrix, are written to CSVs: **distance_matrix.csv** and **melted_filtered_distance_matrix**. Divisive hierarchical clustering is performed on the matrix and a heatmap is generated from the results. The figure is written to the figures folder as **toxcast_priority_cluster.png**.
